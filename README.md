Audience Identification:

The target audience for this report is regional planners within the Bay Area. The report aims to inform its audience of urban patterns that have emerged since the Covid-19 pandemic, most prominently the donut effect - or the hollowing of downtowns and shifting of populations densities towards the suburbs. The report provides evidence of this trend in the Bay Area and ends with specific recommendations and takeaways for city planners. 

Building the Narrative:

The story develops tension by introducing consequences of the donut effect in the introduction, then providing evidence for it, and resolves it by providing recommendations to prepare for the upcoming shifts. By introducing the risk of budget shortfalls and rapid shifts in urban occupancy, I tried to connect with my audience - planners are concerned deeply with these issues, and would like to know if their city is projected to experience these changes and what they can do to mitigate them. 

Design Considerations: 

The markdown was designed to look cohesive and readable, with the viridis and blue color palette used throughout the diagrams and markdown theme. The vertical line and annotation to the graph are used as preattentive attributes. The maps made are interactive, allowing the readers to zoom in and notice changes in tract level data, and the final chart and map is color coded and indicates comparative values. The article is broken down into 4 titled sections, to keep the reader engaged.
